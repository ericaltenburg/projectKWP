# projectKWP

This is a pretty bad implementation of a "stock bot" where I make a URL request to the available cards on KingsWildProject.com and check to see if I can find a keyword of an item through `grep`. If you want to see something funny, look at grabber.py lol

The project was really just me messing around and seeing if I can do something in a silly way. Turns out I can.

### To Run:

`python3 runner.py <Name of the deck>`
